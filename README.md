Rename Images with Date Photo Taken (similar to https://github.com/matthewrenze/rename-images/tree/master)
Purpose: Renames image files in a folder based on date photo taken from EXIF metadata

Behavior:

Given a photo named "Photo Apr 01, 5 54 17 PM.jpg"
with EXIF date taken of "4/1/2018 5:54:17 PM"
when you run this script on its parent folder
then it will be renamed "20180401-175417.jpg"
